          <p style="color:black;">
            How might we use Angela Duckworth's theory of goal-making to make a
            mobile app that increases grit? This assignment was done for a
            Positive Psychology class where we chose a book and were to create a
            final product from it. I chose to do a mobile application.

            <b style="color:black;">Hypothesis</b><br />
            According to Angela Duckworth's book
            <i style="color:black;"
              >Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverence</i
            >, goals can be managed in a more efficient manner that allows to
            increase our grit.

        <div class="paragraph noTop center">
          <p style="color:black;">
            Duckworth states that a goal be made into a goal hierarchy. Low
            level goals would be daily tasks, such as getting up out of bed by
            8AM every morning, running a mile a day, etc. The higher the goal
            the more abstract, general, and important it becomes.

            This is the onboarding screen that displays an illustration to
            welcome users, a typical loading screen that leads you into a sign
            in page.

            <b style="color:black;">Illustrations</b><br />
            Illustrations add a welcoming feeling to the application. This was a
            creative direction I felt that was needed to enhance the warmness of
            the application.

            This part of the application would introduce Duckworth's concept of
            goal making and the user would understand the steps that they need
            to take.

          <p style="color:black;">
            <b style="color:black;">Making Goals</b><br />
            You would make goals in the order of high - mid - low level goals
            according to the explaination and theory of Angela Duckworth.
          </p>
          <p style="color:black;">

            In case you didn't know how to make goals or what kind of goals you
            should be setting there are ? marks on each page.
          </p>
          <p style="color:black;">
              <b style="color:black;">+</b><br />
              You can also add more goals by pressing the plus button depending
              on which level goal you were on.
              The top level goal which is the most abstract can only have one goal 
              as it is the overarching goal for all lower goals.

            Articles and other tabs would include interesting facts that are on
            the topic of goal-making. The one I included in the prototype is an aside
            that was used as a reference for goal-making. This tab would include other
            inspiration and references to grit and goal making.

            Adding achievements to allow the user to feel that there is a solid goal that
            they can accomplish. Since goals can only tracked by oneself achievements would be
            rewarded based on how often the user does the lower, mid level goals.

            You can check on the mid and lower level goals by selecting the top level goal.
            Once clicked you can set notifications and reminders of those specific goals.

            Because the birth of this project was inspired by a book, I would
            like to see users test it and see if grit can actually be reinforced
            by a mobile application. I would do a survey and use a grit
            measuring test before and after the use of the application to see if
            it actually affected one's positie psychology. It would be cool to
            see a team of developers and designers work together to flesh out a
            full mobile application.
