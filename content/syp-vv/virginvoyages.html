            The summer of 2018 I interned at SYP in San Francisco. SYP is a small to mid
            sized consulting firm that specializes in the intersection of strategy and design.
            I worked on business development and a four week consulting project, where I worked
            with project managers, principles, strategists, and designers to solve complicated
            questions and problems.

            This was my first professional internship, which came with both excitement and nervousness.
            The work was challenging and sometimes the hours were late, but it was all rewarding in the end.
            Thanks to SYP I was able to experience a lot of firsts in my life. I went to Florida for the first time.
            I went on my first business trip! I also drove a boat and went on a boat for the first time! It was for our
            project retrospective :).

            I can't show you all the work that I did at SYP, but feel free to send me an email and ask me any
            questions about my experience working at SYP in SF. Thank you to everyone I worked with it was truly a blessing!
