                <p style="color:black;">
                    I redesigned a feature of a KPCB company's product. I was able to
                    focus on any disciplinary area that I was strongest with and I chose
                    to do a visual redesign. </p>

                <p style="color:black;"><b style="color:black;">Context</b><br />
                    Airware is a SAAS platform that provides aerial information for commercial
                    drones. Focuses on providing service to Mining and Quarrying, Construction,
                    Commercial Insurance, Residential Insurance, and Property Management.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph noTop center">
                <p></p>
                <p style="color:black;">
                    <b style="color:black;">The Problems?</b> <br />
                    After looking at Airware’s website and product description, I
                    understood where it was heading and its potential in the market.
                    After going through the website and having other users look at the
                    website, I realized that the tone and visual language of the website
                    were confusing.
                </p>
                <p style="color:black;">
                    Although this is not a direct product of Airware, it
                    connects consumers to the product, which I chose to redesign. Since
                    Airware sells a service, it is essential that the consumer/user
                    understands the service before going into the actual product, which
                    can be done through the website. The way to obtain this service is
                    through the website and accessible through the contact page.
                </p>
                <p style="color:black;">
                    I believe that Airware already has the content and information needed,
                    but a website, such as Airware’s, needs to have clear expectations.
                    By having visual clutter and unclear hierarchy it distracts from
                    otherwise important information. Thinking of the user, who might be
                    of a less tech-savvy background, it led me to the conclusion that
                    having a distinct, clear visual language will help connect the user
                    to the end product in a more positive manner.

                User Painpoints
            </h2>

            <img style="border-radius: 5px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; margin-bottom: 0;"
                src="airware-map.jpg" />
            <div class="paragraph noTop">
                <p class="unit" style="color:black;">
                    <b style="color:#f38fbb">Tabular Language</b><br />
                    The Tabular Language is slightly confusing as it redirects to another page. Using the slanted
                    parallelagram buttons read more as tabs than buttons, should have a more ‘tab-like’ function.
                    Form should follow function.
                </p>
                <p class="unit" style="color:black;">
                    <b style="color:#f0c12f">Broken Functionality</b><br />
                    There is a broken button on the page. Although this is an IT issue, it seems like an overwhelming
                    amount of information is being handled, therefore creating hecticness in the backend of the
                    website.
                </p>
                <p class="unit" style="color:black; clear: left;">
                    <b style="color:#536eb5;">Inconsistent Modular Pages</b><br />
                    The Mining & Quarrying pages had analytics modules, each
                    with their own page afterwards explaining the modules further.
                    It differed from the Construction, Commercial Insurance,
                    Residential Insurance, and Property Management modules,
                    where they did not have their own respective pages. Having an
                    inconsistency can lead the user to be confused when exploring
                    the other industries in comparison to the Mining & Quarry page.
                </p>
                <p class="unit" style="color:black;">
                    <b style="color:#00aeef; clear: right;">Dealership and the Footer</b><br />
                    There is information that is specific to only the footer and not seen anywhere else on the page.
                    By redesigning with a clearer visual hierarchy in mind I feel that redesigning the footer and
                    header, might organize
                    the sections that are uncounted for.
                </p>
                <p class="unit" style="color:black; clear: left;">
                    <b style="color:#abd037;">Same Content Different Pages</b><br />
                    The About section and Career
                    section were in the same
                    hamburger menu, yet there is a
                    button that redirects the user to
                    the Career page. This seems like
                    an unnecessary flow because the
                    Career page should already be
                    seen in the hamburger menu that
                    was displayed on the About page.
                </p>
                <p class="unit" style="color:black;">
                    <b style="color:#df1e26;">The Contact Page</b><br />
                    About 10 of the pages redirect to the Contact page. Because the contact page is the only way to get
                    in touch with the company. I think bridging the bond between the customer and the company will
                    decrease the frustration one might have when interacting with the website.
