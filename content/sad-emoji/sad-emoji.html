            How do we design with emotion? I was assigned to create icons/emojis
            that extended the sad emoji beyond its frown.

            Through research and interviews I recorded how people reacted to the
            sad emoji and asked them to reciprocate it in their own ways. Most
            reacted in a physical expression when the ends of their lips curving
            downwards. Through this I questioned "Does a physical reaction
            necessairily prompt an emotional response?" Through this I began to
            collect images and find stories that illicited a sad emotion. Which
            led me to understand that context and relatability are crucial to
            the expression of sadness.

            I made vinyl stickers that installed around Providence and class
            rooms to create conversations around depression and anxiety.
